sickening that men actually wore them and the music is just ? trash that plays over and over again in almost every scene there is trashy music boobs and ? taking away bodies and the gym still doesn't close for ?

this is not that movie the people tell the story this does such a good job of capturing every moment of their involvement while we enter their world and feel every second with them there is so much beyond the climb that makes everything they go through so much more tense touching the void was also a great doc about mountain climbing and showing the intensity in an engaging way but this film is much more of a human story i just saw it today but i will go and say that this is one of the best documentaries i have ever seen\n","negative\n","?
